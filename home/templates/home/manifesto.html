        <strong>African Design Matters directory</strong> (Est. June 2020) is a timely and relevant global partnership initiative cataloguing the works of underrepresented creative people, comprising Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), Afro-Caribbean and African-borns.

      <h1 class="title">Earlier works and design history by Black Designers</h1>
      <p>The African Design Matters initiative underpins earlier works by Black designers, BIPOC, Afro-Caribbean, and African-born creative people, and of their relevant design and art history that escaped design and art history textbooks. These Black designers include but not limited to: Charles Dawson (1889 - 1981), Aaron Douglas (1899 - 1979), Elmer Simms Campbell (1906 - 1971), Louise E. Jefferson (1908 - 2002), Leroy Winbush (1915 - 2007), Eugene Winslow (1919 - 2001), Georg Olden (1920 - 1975), Thomas Miller (1920 - 2012), Charles “Chuck” Harrison (1931-2018), Emmett McBain (1935 - 2012), Dorothy E. Hayes (1935 - 2015), Archie Boston (born 1943), Emory Douglas (born 1943), Cheryl D. Holmes-Miller (born 1952), Sylvia Harris (1953 - 2011), Art Sims (born 1954), Kerry James Marshall (born 1955), Gail Anderson (born 1962), Arem Dunlessis (b 1991), among others. And in other creative domains, we want to respond to and celebrate the legacy of Nii Amon Kotei (1915-2011), Odinigwe Benedict Chukwukadibia Enwonwu MBE (1917-1994), Kofi Antubam (1922-1964), Theodosia Salome Okoh (1922-2015), Ablade Glover FGA FRSA CV (b. 1934), El Anatsui (b. 1944), Francis Kéré (b. 1944), Ato Delaquis (b. 1945), Yinka Shonibare CBE, RA (b. 1962), Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-1988), among others. By recontextualizing visual material archiving, we pay homage to their persevering spirit and enduring stories. Cheryl D. Holmes-Miller, an American graphic designer, artist, and decolonizing historian, patiently takes us through this history in her articles with PRINT“Black Designers: Missing in Action (1987),” through to the “Black Designers: Forward in Action (Part IV)”.</p>

      <h1 class="title">A Multicultural Creative Community</h1>
      <p>As a multicultural creative community, we acknowledge that African cultures, as well as other cultures, have their own design sensibility and ways of doing things — Design is a cultural response. Cultures demonstrate the many forms of seeing and being in the world, and this influences how we design everything; because we design for people, and people come from different cultures. And we can begin learning from how this continues to enable us to honor the complexities of our cultural differences through design. Thus, the ADM directory aims to represent design in a context that acknowledges that other cultures have their own design sensibilities and ways of doing things.</p>

      <h1>Recontextualizing Visual Material Archive(s) and Archiving</h1>
      <p>And by responding to the cultural memories and design sensibilities that exist in different cultures, we advocate for the idea that design is a cultural response, and a culture of creativity sees creativity in all cultures. We are interested in relooking at visual material archive(s) and archiving within the idea of a “call and response” cataloguing model while underpinning how “archivists tend to use “archive(s)” in a slightly different way than theorists and others who use the term. –­–(Adrienne Pruitt, Archivist, Arts Library Special Collections, Robert B.

      <h1 class="title">Promoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion within Design</h1>
      <p>ADM’s mission is to promote diversity, equity and inclusion within design through promoting the works of marginalized creative communities (Black, Indigenous, People of Color, Afro-Caribbean, and African, among others) and their impact, globally, while using the directory to showcase underrepresented cultures. Also, it is about promoting community engagement, collaboration and professional development of its members.</p>

      <h1 class="title">Celebrating BIPOC and African Creativity, Craftsmanship and Design Excellence</h1>
      <p>The ADM directory celebrates Black, Indigenous, People of Color, Afro-Caribbean, and African creativity, craftsmanship and design excellence in Architecture, Sculpture, Ceramics, Painting, Music, Poetry, Dance, Film, Graphic Design, Industrial Design, Branding Design, Package Design, IU/UX Design, Animation Design, Environmental/Experiential Design, Publishing Design, Print Design, among others. The African Design Matters directory focuses on building curatorial interests spanning other cultural aesthetics, philosophies and design sensibilities that have escaped the existing, Eurocentric, or canonical design history textbooks and curriculum.</p>

      <h1 class="title">A repository of connection, inspiration, and support</h1>
      <p>Aside from becoming a repository of connection, inspiration, and support for design students, creators and the creative community, the ADM directory’s curation aims at pointing design educators, curriculum experts and policymakers in design to what design learning could/can be, and not what it should/must be.</p>

      <h1>What could decolonizing design mean?</h1>
      <p>Knowing design has a heterogeneous cultural past but only a homogeneous cultural history, we are inviting you to join us in reimagining what decolonizing design could/can mean. And with the works by Prof. Cheryl D. Holmes-Miller, Prof. Lesley-Ann Noel and all the great educators behind the Pluriversal Design Bookclub, among others, we are seeing this narrative also changing. But there is more work to be done. We believe the African Design Matters initiative will also accelerate decolonizing design education towards expanding the Design canon, globally. But first, we should acknowledge that “decolonizing design education” is not equal to “decolonizing design educators.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" data-aos="fade-up">
      <h1>Some conditions we must satisfy</h1>
      <p>There are always some conditions we must satisfy if we are to achieve a heterogeneous design history: (i) Challenge our design pedagogy by teaching from the premise that creativity as a central idea in design is a culturally inclusive concept; (ii) Decolonizing design critique sessions by engaging students in projects that honor or pay homage to their respective cultures.</p>
      <p>In Design schools, design critique sessions tend to painstakingly decontextualized culturally relevant ideas to fit a Eurocentric canonical form. Thus, contextual ideas or designs end up being reduced to the most Eurocentric form possible. Familiar?; (iii) Challenge our respective hypotheses by positively connecting and exploring our respective hypotheses around what design learning can / could be; (iv) Start curating and writing about all the visible and invisible cultural responses that have influenced design.</p>

      <p>As a curatorial directory, “a virtual museum” you may call it, we believe museums have vital roles to play in decolonizing design education and how we choose to accept what part of design history should be recorded and what part should not be recorded. In an African Design Matters interview, Professor Dan Hicks, FSA, a British archaeologist and anthropologist, and curator said, “My main point may be that, ethnological museums were invented to create a myth of “nonwestern” design and to claim it was culturally inferior as a form of colonial supremacist thinking.”</p>
      <p>This narrative is also changing, and as observed by the Black Art Project (@BlackArtProject), “Museums that include Black artists in their collection development policy statements, present a richer, diverse, & inclusive art history.”</p>

      <h1 class="title">Educational Resource</h1>
      <p>As an educational resource for design educators, creative people and students, we are interested in making the African Design Matters directory a tool for redefining the future of design, design education and design history.

        And we are doing this by collaborating with multidisciplinary and multicultural design educators, designers and students, globally.</p>
